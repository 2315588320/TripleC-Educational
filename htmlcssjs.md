## Intro
### HTML
HTML (HyperText Markup Language), is the markup language for encoding Web pages. It allows web users to create and structure contents for their website.

### CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows user to style their webpage to make it looks better. Often it is heavily involves with UI/UX design to make the webpage interactive and user friendly.
### JS
JavaScript is a scripting language and it is the primary language chosen to do frontend development mainly because the browser only works with JavaScript so it can work with the browsers APIs such as the [DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) which will be very important when we are doing our project.

## Material

Since it actually covers A LOT OF materials and it is definately not enough (personally it tooks me more than 60+ hours for learning javaScript to a level that can help me to crack the tech interview) to teach everything in one week and we are very rush in time, so I will very briefly explain the syntax of each language and I will attatch a more detailed tutorial video so you can check it out in your own time (Those videos will be very long and it is ***NOT intended to finish it*** for the purpose of this educational project, I put them there is only for people who want to dive deeper into those catagories ***IN THEIR OWN TIME***). In the end of this week, I'm expecting everyone can create a very simple webapp which I will introduce in later section that is made by vanilla javascript.
